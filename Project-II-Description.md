## SIMPLE TO-DO APPLICATION ON MERN WEB STACK



#### What is a MERN stack Web Application


**MERN Stack:** MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: [MongoDB](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mongodb-an-introduction/), [Express](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-express/), [React](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-js-introduction-working/) and [Node.js.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-nodejs/) It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.

Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.

### STEP 1 â€“ BACKEND CONFIGURATION

well here we installed nodejs and NPM

now if you are a beginner you might wonder what is a NPM?

npm is two things: first and foremost,

1. it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects;
2. second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository
   that aids in package installation, version management, and
   dependency management.

After Installation we need to Verify the node & NPM installation
 
### Application Code Setup

Next we will be doing a Application Code setup for out To-Do App
We will Create a Directory for our code setup and initialise our project, so that a new file named package.json will be created. This file will normally contain information about your application and the dependencies that it needs to run.

Next we will be installing EXPRESSJS
then we will be creating a file index.js
next we will be installing the dotenv module.

if you are a begineer you might not know dotenv Module 
#### What is the dotenv module?

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a . env file into process. env . Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

Q. what is the difference between a cluster and database in mongodb atlas
Ans. 
In contrast to a single-server MongoDB database, a MongoDB cluster allows a MongoDB database to either horizontally scale across many servers with sharding, or to replicate data ensuring high availability with MongoDB replica sets, therefore enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the MongoDB cluster.
